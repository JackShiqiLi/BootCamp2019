## Week 1:
- For Felix ECON_PS1 Q2, I was not able to get the tic-tac-toe working, I have written the setup so that all the boards are evaluated to a value, but was not able to figure out a way to iterate in each step.
- For Felis ECON_PS1 Q4(b), I did not have time to do the tensor product, but I have written some notes in the final line of the notebook to address how I would solve it.
