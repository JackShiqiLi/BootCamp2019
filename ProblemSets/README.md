## Week 1:
- For Felix ECON_PS1 Q2, I was not able to get the tic-tac-toe working, I have written the setup so that all the boards are evaluated to a value, but was not able to figure out a way to iterate in each step.
  1. My approach was this: for any given board, especially the very begining ones, all the values after the next move are just zero, so I have to store all of them, and then looking for the next round, until the final round, and then decide which of the moves of the current board will give me a positive value at the very last stage, if I implement this algorithm, for every move the program has to go through every possible states until the last, and this is not value function iteration, so I did not implement this in full but trying to figure out some ways to iterate, but finally I was not able to come up with a way to iterate.
  2. Actually I do not even know what the iteration should be converge to, in my opinion it just converges to 0...
- For Felix ECON_PS1 Q4(b), I did not have time to do the tensor product, but I have written some notes in the final line of the notebook to address how I would solve it.  
## Week 2:
- Attending DSE summer school and conferences, no homework.
## Week 3:
- This week's homework is done in group, with joint effort from Rayhan Momin, Dohan Kim, Eric Huang, Xincheng Qiu and Shiqi Li.
- Finished all problems form Measure Theory, DSGE and HPC's day2 exercises, for HPC's day1 exercises, the stochastic growth model did not work well.
- For Measure Theory homework, refer to MATH >> ProblemSet1_Measure_Theory >> Measure_Theory_PS1.pdf.  
- For Kerk's DSGE homework, refer to ECON >> ProblemSet2_DSGE >> DSGE_PS1_Intro.ipynb, DSGE_PS2_Linearization.ipynb, DSGE_PS3_Perturbation.ipynb, Week3_ECON_PS1.pdf, Week3_ECON_PS2.pdf.  
- For Simon's HPC homework, refer to the other repository named OSE2019 >> ProblemSets.
## Week 4:
- HPC: got the idea of MPI and OMP, completed all the small exercises, did some minor changes on the projects, but did not compare the speeds for the projects between OMP, MPI and hybrid.
- OG model: completed all the exercises, had quite good understanding on the basics of overlapping generations model.
- Firm Dynamics: The lecture was very hard for me to catch up, tried hard to understand the materials and completed the dynare exercises, for the big exercise, was not able to finish, but was able to write out the setups, will come back to the codes if have time in the future.
## Week 5:
- Heterogenous agent: the simulation does not work well, all else done.
- Asset pricing: all done, the orderbook class has some reference to Rebekah Dix's BootCamp2018 repo.
- Pandas and Newton, Quasi-Newton: all done.
